Changes in Angband 3.0.5:
- Summoned creatures appear near the caster now instead of near the
  player.
- Made rods of detection invulnerable to electric attacks.
- Restored the old behavior of the Glyph of Warding to protect against
  direct melee attacks when standing on it.
- Rods can no longer be drained by monsters.
- The minor vault "Interlock" had switched height and width definitions,
  causing it to be created in a chaotic state. (Werner Baer)
- Spells that prompt the user for an item (identify, enchantment,
  recharging) or an monster letter (banishment) no longer use mana if
  canceled.
- The order of mage spells in the books in the non-Lua version is now
  the same as in the Lua version.
- Give energy to monsters and the player at the end of the game turn
  instead of at the start.  This prevents various odd effects when
  loading a saved game. (reported by Phil)
- The activation descriptions for rings were missing with Lua scripting
  turned off. (Jeff Greene)
- The SHATTER (earthquake) attack of monsters can cause the player to be
  pushed into another position.  Processing of the remaining blows of
  the monster should stop in that case. Otherwise the player could get
  hit "through a wall" that was created by the earthquake. (Jeff Greene)
- Removed the autoroller delay.
- Cleaned up the paragraph handling in the object descriptions.
  (Hallvard B Furuseth)
- "It cannot be harmed by acid and fire" should be "... acid *or* fire".
  (Hallvard B Furuseth)
- Piles of wands, staves, and rods can be used from the ground without
  picking them up first.
- Fixed a problem in the Unix/Linux makefiles.  The POSIX standard
  doesn't allow a dot instead of a colon as separator for the chown
  parameters.
- Removed an accidental use of floating point code that prevented
  Angband from running on old machines without an FPU.
- Removed unnecessary event handlers that negativly affected performance.
- The "pseudo graphics" used by the (n)curses version didn't support
  terrain lightning correctly.
- The window resize control was sometimes overwritten with a black tile
  in the OS X version.
- Removed the warning message about missing preferences from the OS X
  version.  The first thing a new player sees after starting Angband
  shouldn't be a "scary" message.
- Added a Windows helpfile created by Jordan Hobbs.
- Added project files for building Angband with MS Visual C++ 7.1.
  (Tasha Jessup)

Changes in Angband 3.0.4:
- Made the water vortex immune to water-based attacks.
- Chaos resistance protects against confusion by chaos based attacks.
- Smoothed out the tables for extra mana-points per level, hitpoint
  bonus from constitution, "spells per level" vs. "spell stat", and
  INT/WIS dependent failure rate adjustment.  The old steps have been
  replaced by a steady increase, so small stat improvements are more
  useful.  Please note that this will also affect characters imported
  from older versions, so these might gain or lose some spells, mana,
  and hitpoints when imported into Angband 3.0.4.
- Gave the 'thanc daggers a 2d4 damage dice instead of 1d4 and made them
  more common. (Jonathan Ellis)
- Gave each of the Paur* gauntlets a single minor power (slow-digestion,
  regeneration, permanent light, feather fall) and made them more
  common. (Jonathan Ellis)
- Rods, wands, and staves with different charges can now be stacked.
  (based on the NPPAngband version that in turn is based on
  Leon Marrick's rod/wand stacking in OAngband.
- Rods can't be recharged anymore, but can be vulnerable to electricity.
- Rods of Recall, Perception, Curing, Healing, Restoration, and Speed
  will not be destroyed by electricity.
- Made Raal's Tome of Destruction more, and Kelek's Grimoire of Power
  less common. (Timo Pietilä)
- Heavy crossbows no longer can get the 'of the Haradrim' suffix and
  'light crossbows of the Haradrim' get a smaller damage bonus. (Timo
  Pietilä)
- Removed fire brand from ammo 'of Holy Might'. (Timo Pietilä)
- Give the short range teleport effect from gravity attacks on monsters
  an additional 1 in 3 chance to teleport the monster away.  This should
  make abusing the Rift spell a bit harder.
- Added a level dependent chance to resist the teleportation effect of
  gravity attacks for monsters and the player. (suggested by Jonathan
  Ellis)
- Junk items like broken sticks, empty bottles, and rodent skeletons are
  no longer generated in the dungeon.
- Removed the old haggling code.  The auto-haggling code is now
  permanently active and will give the normal price of items without the
  10% "sales tax".
- Replaced the old screendump code with HTML screendump code that
  handles graphics, bigscreen, bigtile, and other display oddities much
  better. (based on the htmldump-patch by Darkgod).
- Added support for artifact and ego-item descriptions. (with help from
  Hallvard B Furuseth)
- Added artifact descriptions.  The texts are mainly taken from OAngband
  and other variants. (Jonathan Ellis)
- Added object descriptions assembled by Hallvard B Furuseth.  The
  descriptions are mostly copied from obj-long.spo version 3.0.2 by Hugo
  Kornelis, Stephen S. Lee, Leonard Dickens and Craig Lewis.
- Added ego item descriptions for some ego types. (Hallvard B Furuseth)
- "Easy open" ignores broken doors now when trying to close doors.
- Added the equipment flag matrix to the character dump.
- Added new 8x8 tiles and tile definitions provided by "Dawnmist".
- Added the player's maximum depth in the dungeon to the character
  display and the dump.
- Removed several broken tile definitions for the 32x32 tiles.
- Use the proper monster flags instead of workarounds for various
  resists and immunities.  This also allows the reporting of these flags
  in the monster recall and the spoilers. (pointed out by Leon Marrick)
- You can now use either 'm' or 'p' to cast spells or pray.
- Allow direct melee attacks on visible monsters in walls.  You still
  have to tunnel into the wall if you are trying to attack an invisible
  monster. (suggested by Greg Stark)
- Show infos like "It cannot be harmed by the elements." when
  'Inspecting' books, just as for other item types.
- Changed the behavior of the 'auto_more' option, so that it
  automatically skips '-more-' prompts instead of not displaying
  messages on the top line. (Tom Houser)
- Changed the "Do you really want to quit?" prompt to "Do you really
  want to commit suicide?".
- Added a 'show scores' command to the knowledge menu.
- Changed the wording for the scores display a bit.
- Added the kill count of non-unique monsters to the knowledge menu.
- Added a modified version of Mogami's macro trigger patch. This patch
  modifies how macro trigger keys are displayed on screen and written in
  .prf files.  The trigger keys are no longer displayed in ugly key code
  style, such like ^__FFBE\r or ^_O_FF53\r, but in more smart style,
  such like \[F1] or \[alt-Right].
- Added a better character selection screen with support for using the
  cursor keys, display of info about the various race and class choices,
  and context sensitive help.  The code is based on the EyAngband's
  birth screen that again is probably based on ZAngband's birth screen.
- Select the sex, race, and class choices from a dead character as
  defaults for a new character.
- Added a stripped down version of Takeshi Mogami's "auto_dump" feature
  from Hengband.  Automatic pref file dumps from the game are now
  marked, so that they can be replaced when dumping to the same
  pref-file again.
- Allow the banishment spell to be aborted at the "Choose a monster race
  to banish" prompt without using up a scroll or charge.
- Added John Rauser's monster list patch that allows the user to display
  a list of the visible monsters in a window.
- Improved the navigation in the help files.
- Recharging wands or staves that have been fully *identified* before
  will now automatically reveal the new number of charges in the device.
  This fixes a bug where an already *ID'ed* wand or staff couldn't be
  *ID'ed* again after recharging (but plain ID works), despite the
  number of charges being unknown. (bug reported by Eddie Grove)
- text_to_ascii() didn't check that the characters used in \xAB
  sequences represent real hex characters.  Invalid hex sequences are
  now converted to the '?' character. (reported by Kieron Dunbar)
- Improved the handling of incomplete '\x' sequences in macros.  The old
  code could skip the final NUL-byte of the string if it ended with
  '\x', leading to a potential buffer overflow.
- Fixed a typo in the description of the "wild cat". (Jay McAbee)
- Monster groups ignored their fear when the smart_packs option was
  turned on. (reported by Eddie Grove)
- Rods and staves of probing are no longer automatically identified when
  used without a monster nearby. (reported by "someog")
- Prevent the player from being hit multiple times by area effect spells
  and breaths that can blink the player (nexus, gravity).
- The player can now get a level feeling when entering level 1 without
  spending 1000 game turns in town first. (Tom Houser)
- Branding ammo or weapons will now automatically try to combine and
  reorder the resulting objects, even if the enchantment of to-hit and
  to-dam fails. (reported by John D. Goulden)
- Try to output minor warning messages (such as "illegal option choice"
  when selecting a non existing item for a command) as soon as possible.
  (reported by "Mogami")
- Show all minor error messages immediately in the message window.
- The effects of light spells are only obvious if you aren't blind.
- Wands and rods of light don't give a message and aren't automatically
  identified when using them while blind. (reported by Steve Kroon)
- Refilling a latern from a stack of laterns will now only use the oil
  from one latern, not from the whole stack. (reported by Jay McAbee)
- Prevent earthquake/destruction spells from working in town.  This
  prevents inappropriate messages (like "The cave ceiling collapses!").
- Automatically try to load the "Kobold.prf" file at startup if the
  player is a Kobold.
- Improved the output of item and monster descriptions in spoilers and
  character dumps.  In some cases punctuation and spaces were wrapped to
  the next line.
- The basic object spoilers only reported the prices for unidentified
  items.  (reported by Hugo Kornelis)
- Only print the "You feel (less) resistant to ..." messages when not
  immune to the specific element. (reported by Jeff Greene)
- The cursor keys in the X11 ports behave the same way now, no matter if
  num-lock is on or off.
- Change colors in main-gcu.c. This is Dominik Grzelak's patch to change
  bright white from blue back to bright white. (Ed Cogburn)
- Added a workaround for a bug in the curses version with USE_GETCH.
  The news.txt screen was erased by the first call to the getch()
  function. (Frank Palazzolo)
- Angband consumed 100% of the cpu while waiting for a keypress in the
  GTK port. (Sheldon Simms)
- Allow text to be copied from the game window in the X11 port.
  (modified version of the code in Kieron Dunbar's sCthangband 1.0.10)
- Added transparency support to the 32x32 tiles in the Windows port.
  This requires a modified tiles bitmap and a new transparency mask
  originally created by Andrew Doull:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-304.zip
- Removed the hackish 'Show scores' menu entry from the Windows version.
  Use the new knowledge menu entry instead.
- Applied lots of Mac specific patches by "pelpel".
- Allow initialization of the game to continue, even if the
  lib/data/*.raw files can't be written.  In that case the data parsed
  from the lib/edit/*.txt files stays in memory and is used instead of
  the *.raw data.  This currently wastes some memory, since the text
  arrays are not resized to the minimum required length.
- Added a performance tweak for the Angband Borg.
- Increased the data-type of the shopkeeper purse limit from signed
  16 bit to signed 32 bit.  This will allow shopkeepers with a higher
  limit than 32768 gold to be added.
- Added a compile time option to store the savefiles and scores in the
  player's home directory (under ~/.angband/Angband/) on multi-user
  machines.
- Use a different delay function in the DOS version that works around
  the restricted 55ms resolution on Windows 2000 and XP.

Changes in Angband 3.0.3:
- Reduced the size of the 32x32 tiles bitmap.  The smaller bitmap should
  fix the problem on older Windows versions (Windows 95 and 98) with
  restrictions of the maximal bitmap size .
  The tiles are available as a separate download from:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/graf-32x32-302.zip
- Fixed a bug in the text-output routines used for character dumps that
  sometimes introduced bogus output. (reported by Pasi Vartiainen)
- Fixed a wrong entry in the template for the X11 startup shell script.
  ("Mynstral")
- Fixed the display of *slays* in character dumps. (Matthias Kurzke)
- The "It might have hidden powers." message will now displayed in the
  character dumps.  This makes it easier to see if an artifact or ego-item
  with random abilities has already been *identified*.
- Curses on unidentified items are no longer revealed in character dumps or
  in the output of the 'Inspect' command.
- Fixed a typo - "intellegence". (Greg Stark)
- Updated the DOS version to compile with the latest version of the Allegro
  library.

Changes in Angband 3.0.2:
- Limited the maximum size of floor stacks to 23, so that get_item() can
  always display a list containing all objects.
- Renamed 'genocide' to 'banishment' and 'mass genocide' to 'mass
  banishment' since that name fits much better to the effect.  The priest's
  'banishment' spell has been renamed to 'banish evil' to avoid confusion
  and since that is what it actually does.
- Replaced silver arrows and bolts with mithril ammo since slay evil was
  too powerful.
- Changed the color of seeker bolts to green since there are so many 'light
  blue' ammo objects now.
- 'Golden staves' had the wrong color. (John I'anson-Holton)
- Improved indentation of the object descriptions in the character dump.
  (Andrew Sidwell)
- Destruction/Earthquake spells didn't properly destroy stacks of objects.
  After saving and loading the game, parts of the stacks were restored.
  (reported by Matthias Kurzke)
- Zapping a stack of recharging rods would instantly recharge all but one
  of them. (Tormod Haugen)
- Fixed an error in the LCC Makefile.
- Fixed an off-by-one error that prevented savefiles with the maximum
  number of monsters or objects from loading correctly. (Takeshi Mogami)
- Fixed an abuse that allowed the player to kill a monster with a ball
  spell by staying out of sight and detection range of the monster while
  the monster just patiently waited without ever getting a turn (reported
  by Tormod Haugen).  Wounded monsters will now always get their turn, even
  when out of range.
- The Elfstone 'Elessar' and the Jewel 'Evenstar' have the INSTA_ART flag
  now to make the APW-Borg happy.
- Amulets of resistance are now fully known after identifying one for the
  first time. (Dr. Andrew White)
- The option for flushing of pending input when failing to cast a spell
  didn't work.
- Fixed several bugs in the scorefile handling that could lead to
  duplicated entries for a single character. (reported by Hallvard Furuseth
  and Mauro Scarpa)
- Unified the code for object infos and artifact spoilers. (Andrew Sidwell)
- Added event-handler code to call Lua functions when things happen	in the
  game.
- Allow multiple Lua event handlers per event.
- Moved the generation of the player's fixed starting equipment (food and
  torches) to a Lua event handler.
- Which objects a store will buy and sell is now determined by a Lua
  script.
- Added various improvments to make finding errors in Lua code easier.
- The lib/edit/*.txt files can now optionally contain the names of the
  default object, monster, terrain, and flavor colors instead of just a
  character specifying the Angband color code.
- Changed the format of the flavor.txt file to make parsing easier.
- Allow the use of the Angband version number in conditional statements of
  the *.prf file format.
- Added Takeshi Mogami's bigtile patch that allows tile-graphics to have
  doubled width.
- Added support for David Gervais' 32x32 tileset to the Windows, X11, and
  XAW ports.  The tiles are available as a separate download from:
  ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Extra/32x32.zip
  (Takeshi Mogami)
- Improved the error message when a font can't be loaded in the X11 and
  XPJ frontends.
- Fixed a memory leak when switching between the various tilesets in the
  Windows version.

Changes in Angband 3.0.1:
- Added support for creating ego-item light-sources in ego_item.txt.
- Added bigscreen support to main-gcu.c. (pelpel)
- Check the panel-bounds more carefully to prevent problems when using
  a huge main window (heigher or wider than the dungeon).
- Added the missing error message for a vault that is too big.
- Applied the bugfixes from the new Lua 4.0.1 release. (Lua devteam)
- Added a boundary check to the macro adding code to prevent crashes
  when defining more than the maximum number of macros. (Eytan Zweig)
- Fixed various potential buffer overflows.
- Updated the Makefile for the lcc-win32 compiler and added compile
  instructions to compile.txt.
- Added x-spell.o and use-obj.o to various Makefiles and fixed some
  missing dependencies. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- my_strnicmp() in main-ros.c was quite buggy. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- The islower(), isupper(), ... and the tolower() and toupper()
  functions take an 'int' as the argument but actually expect it to be
  an 'unsigned char' or EOF.  We now cast the argument to 'unsigned
  char' to prevent breakage with 8-bit character data on hosts where
  'char' is signed.  (based on the patch by Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- Fixed an off-by-one error when checking if playing Angband is allowed
  at this time of day. (Hallvard B. Furuseth)
- Fixed the activation of 'The Shield of Deflection of Gil-galad'.
- Show the 'cursed' flag of artifacts in the spoilers. (KUSUNOSE Toru)
- Fixed a bug that allowed changes to the 'birth_no_stacking' birth-
  option to affect the current game. (KUSUNOSE Toru)

Changes in Angband 3.0:
- Added Jonathan Ellis' JLE patch that adds a new player race
  ("Kobold"), many new artifacts, vaults, monsters, objects, and
  ego-items; rebalances the gameplay; and adds a new color scheme for
  monsters.
- Added some new object flags ("kill demon", "kill undead"),
  activations, monster attacks ("cause halluzination") and monster
  spells/abilities (summon animal, throw boulder) for the JLE patch.
- Replaced the Mage, Rogue, and Ranger spell-lists with the spell-list
  from Greg Wooledge's GWAngband. This gives magic-users a much broader
  range of attack-spells to choose from including chaos, nether, sound,
  shards, and gravity effects.  Other big changes are the removal of
  the 'Globe of Invulnerability' and the addition of 'Rune of
  Protection'.
- ***** WARNING *****: All spells known by magic-users are discarded
  when importing an old savefile, so that the player can choose freely
  from the new spell-list.  Don't forget to relearn your spells before
  trying to use them.  Macros/keymaps with old spells probably won't
  work anymore - change them if necessary.
- Standing on a glyph no longer protects the player from melee
  attacks.
- Increased the range of infravision granted by potions of
  infravision to +5.
- Increased the damage of many wands and rods.
- The player can now reset the recall depth when recalling from a
  level above the deepest reached level.
- Adjusted the damage caps for various breath attacks. (JLE)
- Made the light radius cumulative.
- Added the Lua scripting language < http://www.lua.org/ > for easier
  customization.  Currently the scripts handle the effects of using
  objects such as staves, wands, rods, potions, scrolls, food, and
  activatable objects.  The player-spells are also defined in a script.
- Added support for object descriptions that are displayed when
  examining objects.
- Moved the item flavors into an external file and added *.prf files
  for the flavors.
- Added message compression ("You tunnel into the granite wall. <5x>").
- Added a display of the player's current equipment aka "equippy chars"
  to the main screen.
- Various prompts at player birth use 'Enter' instead of 'ESC' now.
- Added a no-item-stacking-on-floor birth-option.
- Improved the layout of the store prompts a bit.
- Added basic support for a bigger main window (bigscreen). Note that
  the town will be regenerated when loading an old savefile, so don't
  leave any objects on the floor when you upgrade your savefile!
- Added support for a hitpoint-warning sound effect.
- You can now browse books in the stores.
- Reorganized and cleaned up the list of options.
- The known uniques list is now separated into two columns to make it
  easier to read. One column for the names and one for the
  "is dead/alive" text.
- Allowed examining multiple items without having to return to the
  tombstone screen.
- Added an option to review messages to the tombstone.
- Changed the keys to view high scores from 't' to 'v' and allowed
  upper case for each of the options in the tombstone screen.
- Added color to the monster recall.
- Allowed using the roguelike keyset to navigate in the options screen.
- Savefiles from pre-2.9.0 versions are no longer accepted.
- Replaced the old (Acorn) RISC OS code with a newer version.
- Added new VisualC++ 6.0 project files provided by Peter Rowe.
- The default number of windows for the GTK port is now 1 instead of 8.
- Fixed a crash-bug on WinXP machines when reading the filenames of
  sounds. (Werner Baer)
- Executables build with configure under Cygwin no longer require the
  Cygwin DLL.
- Added the latest Amiga code (Bablos).
- Fixed a possible crash when searching disarmed chests for traps.
- Monsters draining large stacks of wands or staffs could get negative
  hitpoints due to the overflow of a signed 16 bit variable.
- Fixed the problems with the 'repeat command' command.
- Bounds-checking for detection spells and some wizard mode commands
  was missing.  That could cause crashs when resizing the Terms.
- 'Interact with visuals' could display negative char numbers.
- Don't partially repair blasted equipment when loading the savefile.
- Fixed a bug that caused an infinite loop in the RNG when the u32b
  type has more than 32 bits.
- The confirmation for wizard mode was required every time wizard mode
  was switched on.
- Vaults could sometimes have up to 9 times the requested number of
  monsters.
  Improvements by Hallvard B Furuseth:
- Running 'angband --help' will now display basic usage info.
- Problems with the lib/ folder were not correctly reported when using
  the (n)curses interface.
- Fixed a minor problem with curses on machines with signed-chars.
- Fixed a possible integer overflow in the gamma correction code on
  16 bit machines.
- Various bugfixes and improvements in the SLang, XAW, VME, VCS, GCU,
  XPJ, Acorn, and GTK frontends.

  harmed by the elements." instead of one line for each element.
- Updated the documentation for the lib/edit/*.txt file formats.
- The randart info is now stored in the savefile.
- Various command-line options like wizard- and fiddle-mode are now
  available from the *.ini file of the Windows version.
- Improved the GTK, X11, and XAW ports.
- The cursor in the X11 and XAW modules is a rectangle, instead of a
  filled box.
- Made the windows of the XAW module resizable.
- Added Steven Fuerst's X11 projected view (start with -mXPJ where
  available).

  health even if CON was drained.
- Added the Linux vcsa display driver written by Alexander Malmberg.
- Gave the *_info.txt files more meaningful names.

  then only the resistance was shown in the character display grid.
- Fixed a typo in the "bless" spell.
- Ego-items generated in vaults should now be of the proper level.
- Used staircases are now always marked as known when the connected_stairs
  option is turned on.

- Fixed a compile problem in the Windows version when USE_GRAPHICS is
  turned off.
- The random selection of sound samples in the Windows and DOS version got
  non-random after a while.
- The message when dropping a known artifact is now something like "You no
  longer have the Golden Crown of Gondor" instead of "You have no more
  Golden Crowns of Gondor".
- Finding out that a wand or staff has no charges left didn't update the
  inventory window.
- Attacks that didn't do any damage could sometimes scare wounded monsters.
- Monsters at 1% of max hps got frightened less often than monsters with
  10% hps left.
- The item flag descriptions when tweaking items in wizard mode are now
  correct.
- Removed the special handling for weapons of Morgul and ammo of backbiting.
- Moved the "Lesser vault" and "Greater vault" strings into the source.
- The get_string() and askfor_aux() functions now use the 'len' argument
  as the buffer size instead of the maximum length of the input string.
- Corrected the message when encountering an error while parsing a
  lib/edit/*.txt file.
- The path_temp() function is no longer compiled if mkstemp() is
  available.
- Removed a hack for the curses module of some BSD versions.
- Fixed some problems on BSD machines with the ACS macros for the special

  ALLOW_TEMPLATES #define.
- The *.prf file loading code checks for invalid message colors.
- Fixed the inversed logic for handling tabs in files.
- Changed the title of the 'Known artifacts' list to the more truthful

  displayed an uninitialized colour name.
- Corrected the names of some options in the documentation.
- Fixed some errors in the lsl module, but it's still buggy.
- Improved the autoconf support. The Cygwin compiler is now supported,

  DESTDIR is now supported, and a workaround for a bug in some versions of
  the GCC compiler is turned on.
- Cleaned up the source code and some of the Makefiles.

Changes in Angband 2.9.2:
- Fixed several security problems (buffer overflows, tempfile-races,
  reading files that the player has no permission to read, and incorrect or
  missing bounds-checking).
- Splitted the lib/user/ folder into lib/pref/ for the default "pref files"

  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.

  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.

  folder in your Angband-directory.

  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').
