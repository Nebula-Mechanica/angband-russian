Colorname support in the lib/edit/*.txt files, and various utility

The developers of the Lua scripting language and the 'tolua' wrapper
generators for a nice scripting language that is not only easy to learn
and use, but also incredibly small and fast!

The UPX team (Markus Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar)
The UPX packer for executables < http://upx.tsx.org/ > is used to reduce
the size of the Windows and DOS binaries.

The Lua < http://www.lua.org > team from TeCGraf, the Computer Graphics
Technology Group of PUC-Rio, including Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, Waldemar
Celes, and Roberto Ierusalimschy.  Lua is a light-weight programming language
that is used in Angband to script things like object use and spell effects.

I hope I've remembered everyone who ought to be mentioned here. If your
name should be included, my apologies, and please tell me so I can correct
the oversight!
